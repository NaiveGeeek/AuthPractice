# What is Authentication?
It is the process of determining whether a user is who they say they are.

# Different types of Authentication 
# 1 Single-Factor/Primary Authentication
Its most common form of authentication and its the least secure as it only requires username and password to gain full acess to the system.

# 2 Two Factor Authentication
It add an additional layer of verification to identify valid user so its harder to break. It require username , password as well as additional piece of identifying information such as one-time password, biometric, SMS code etc.

# 3 Single Sign On (SSO)
With this user login on one application and get access to many other applicaitions. Organizations can accomplish this by identifying a central domain (most ideally, an IAM system) and then creating secure SSO links between resources.

# 4 Multi-fator Authentication
It uses more system--irrelevant factors to legitimize users. Like 2FA, MFA uses factors like biometrics, device-based confirmation, additional passwords, and even location or behavior-based information (e.g., keystroke pattern or typing speed) to confirm user identity. 


# Most Common Authentication Protocol 
# 1 Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)

# 2 Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

# 3 Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
